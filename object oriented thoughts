Object Oriented Design is the concept that forces programmers to plan out their code in order to have a better flowing program

After the analysis phase, the conceptual model is developed further into an object-oriented model using object-oriented design (OOD). In OOD, the technology-independent concepts in the analysis model are mapped onto implementing classes, constraints are identified, and interfaces are designed, resulting in a model for the solution domain. In a nutshell, a detailed description is constructed specifying how the system is to be built on concrete technologies

The stages for object–oriented design can be identified as −

  Definition of the context of the system
  Designing system architecture
  Identification of the objects in the system
  Construction of design models
  Specification of object interfaces
